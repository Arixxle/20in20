# 20 Web Apps In 20 Weeks
Hello and welcome to the repository for my 20 in 20 challenge. This repo will contain all of the versions of all of the projects that were created over the course of this 20 week video series. If you would like a link to the series or a specific week's playlist, those can be found below. I will attempt to update all the ReadME's as time permits, though the recording process can take a bit out of me.

# Potential issues with cloning this repository
You might run into an issue if you attempt to clone this entire repository in order to access a version of the project used after the project was deployed to production. The reason is we created a github repository in order to use capistrano for those files, so you might have to go visit those individual repositories in order to clone. Sorry for the inconvenience!
